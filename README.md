### Overview

The series of notebooks, data files, data visual images, and slideshow presentation contained herein include a review of SAT testing outcomes with specific policy recommendations geared to the executives of the College Board. Many of the prompts in the notebook files are generated by General Assembly (GA), but the problem statement, data analysis and visualization, and ultimate policy recommendations represent the expertise and opinions of the author. The following README file contains an executive summary of the problem statement, data dictionaries for cleaned datasets, summary of data analysis, and recommendations presented before the College Board.

### Problem Statement

The executives of the College Board are concerned with the growing number of colleges which are dropping SAT testing requirements. The board executives would like to get a picture of the "ideal profile" of high school students to whom the College Board should pivot its marketing efforts for test preparation and registration.

* Based on current testing outcomes, which students would be ideal candidates to market test preparation materials and courses with the intent of growing SAT market share? The ideal student profile should include geographic location, traits of the colleges to which students are likely to apply, and intended major.

### Datasets & Data Dictionaries

Although GA provided 10 original datasets to investigate, only three were chose to clean, prepare, and analyze. The three original datasets are presented below:

* [`sat_2019.csv`](./data/sat_2019.csv): 2019 SAT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent))
* [`sat_2019_by_intended_college_major.csv`](./data/sat_2019_by_intended_college_major.csv): 2019 SAT Scores by Intended College Major ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20220426162357/https://reports.collegeboard.org/pdf/2019-total-group-sat-suite-assessments-annual-report.pdf))
* [`sat_act_by_college.csv`](./data/sat_act_by_college.csv): Ranges of Accepted ACT & SAT Student Scores by Colleges ([source](https://www.compassprep.com/college-profiles/))

After cleaning and preparing the data, the following three updated data files were saved and stored in the data directory:
* [`updated_sat_2019.csv`](./data/updated_sat_2019.csv): Updated SAT 2019
* [`sat_by_major.csv`](./data/sat_by_major.csv): SAT by Major
* [`sat_by_college.csv`](./data/sat_by_college.csv): SAT by College

For each of the three updated csv file datasets, the data dictionaries are provided below:

### Summary of Analysis

In analyzing the data, certain assumptions were made:

* To bring in new students to SAT testing, we should identify potential growth markets.
* Students who are performing on the SAT slightly below the median of their peers may have the greatest potential to wish to enhance their tests scores.

The following steps were taken in analyzing the three datasets chosen:

* Tests scores and participation rates were compared across states to look for trends in growth of both market share and scores.
* Ranges of below median SAT scores for students accepted to colleges were compared to acceptance rates at those college to investigate patterns of how exclusive schools are in their admissions of slightly underperforming students.
* Test takers' intended college majors were compared to numbers of testers and average scores to look for trends in which groups of intended majors had the highest need to test preparation in the greatest numbers.

### Conclusions and Recomendations

The "ideal profile" of a high school student primed for a marketing campaign for SAT test preparation includes:

* A student from large states with potential for market share growth, including California, Georgia, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington.
* A student applying to second-tier colleges and universities who have some moderately exclusive acceptance rates. Many in this list include large public university systems.
* A student who is intending to major in healthcare or business and managerial professions.
